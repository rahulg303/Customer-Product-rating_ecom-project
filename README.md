## **Overview**

This is a Flask based app which predicts the customer review rating. Basis on the prdiction rating E-commerce platform can deduce whether to suggest better offer to the customer or recommed similar products.

##
## **Motivation**

Being from a Math and stats eductaional background ,I started to learn Machine Learning algorithms with the help of the ineuron platform to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Ineuron platform had given me all the resources to learn at an very affordable costs and motivation as well to finally work on the real world projects to actually make a difference.

##
## **Installation**

The Code is written in Python 3.7.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.
